# About me
Yi SUN received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2015. She is currently an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science (National Pilot Software Engineering School), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. 

Her research interest includes Information Security, Privacy Computing, Artificial Intelligence Security, World Model.

Email: sybupt@bupt.edu.cn

**Note**: I’m actively looking for self-motivated students and researchers to collaborate on frontier topics in Information Security and World Model related research. If you’re interested in my research directions, please feel free to reach out to me.

**Note**: My recent research focuses on the following question: What happens if we apply a "force" to data? Herein, the "force" refers to any possible strategy, like a force with direction that can act on an object, causing it to move forward, descend, rotate, and so on.
